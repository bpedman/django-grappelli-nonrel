Grappelli Readme
----------------------------------------------------------------

*   Web: code.google.com/p/django-grappelli/

Welcome to Grappelli! This skin provides a fresh & useable
surface for the powerfull Django Admin Interface. Furthermore it 
expands some functions of the Django Admin Interface and 
outlines future development possibilities. Therefor Grappelli
is made for Mozilla Firefox 3+ (but also should work with
Safari 3+).
That gives the opportunity to use some CSS3 specifications which
are really practical and are going to be implemented in future
browser-developments for sure. To cut down efforts support for
other browsers (versions) is not guaranteed.

Grappelli consist of the original Django Admin Interface CSS &
images and the Gappelli-specific CSS & images. It comes as a
package - all you have to do is to move it to the location where

interface delivered without the Grappelli styles.
