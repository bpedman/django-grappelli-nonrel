Welcome to Grappelli! This skin provides a nice-looking & useable
surface for the powerfull Django Admin Interface. Furthermore it 
expands some functions of the Django Admin Interface and 
outlines future development possibilities. Therefor it is made
for Mozilla Firefox 3.0+ (that gives the opportunity to use some
CSS3 Specifications which are really practical and are going to be
implemented in future browser-developments for sure). To cut down
efforts support for other browsers (versions) is not guaranteed.
The main features and characteristics of Grappelli are:

Setup instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here's how you set up Grappelli on your site.

Grappelli consist of the original Django Admin Interface CSS &
images and the Gappelli-specific CSS and images. It comes as a
package - all you have to do is to move it to the space where
your Django Admin Styles situated. If you need to deacivate 
Grappelli just open the Django Admins 'base.css' and comment out
the included 'grappelli.css'. You will get your administration
interface delivered without the Grappelli styles.

1) Upload the "blueprint" folder in this folder to your server, 
   and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice 
   would be your CSS folder.

2) Add the following three lines to every <head> section of your
   site. Make sure the three href paths are correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder):

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/print.css" type="text/css" media="print"> 
   <!--[if IE]><link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/ie.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection"><![endif]-->
	
	 Remember to include trailing slashes (" />") in these lines if you're using XHTML.

3) For development, add the .showgrid class to any container or column
   to see the underlying grid. Check out the 'plugins' directory for
   more advanced functionality.

Files in Blueprint
----------------------------------------------------------------

The framework has a few files you should check out. Every file
in the 'src' directory contains lots of (hopefully) clarifying 
comments.

Compressed files (these go in the HTML):

* blueprint/screen.css
* blueprint/print.css
* blueprint/ie.css

Source files:

* blueprint/src/reset.css
  This file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.

* blueprint/src/grid.css
  This file sets up the grid (it's true). It has a lot of classes
  you apply to divs to set up any sort of column-based grid.

* blueprint/src/typography.css
  This file sets some default typography. It also has a few
  methods for some really fancy stuff to do with your text.

* blueprint/src/forms.css
  Includes some minimal styling of forms.

* blueprint/src/print.css
  This file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions
  of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be 
  included on every page.

* blueprint/src/ie.css
  Includes every hack for our beloved IE6 and 7.

Scripts:

* lib/compress.rb
  A Ruby script for compressing and customizing your CSS. Set a
  custom namespace, column count, widths, output paths, multiple 
  projects, and semantic class names. See commenting in compress.rb 
  or run $ruby compress.rb -h for more information.

* lib/validate.rb
  Validates the Blueprint core files with the W3C CSS validator.

Other:

* blueprint/plugins/
  Contains additional functionality in the form of simple plugins
  for Blueprint. See individual readme files in the directory
  of each plugin for further instructions.

* tests/
  Contains html files which tests most aspects of Blueprint.
  Open tests/index.html for further instructions.
